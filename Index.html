        <h2 id="about">Biography</h2>
                   <div class="bio"> 
                    <p>Swedish-born conductor Andreas Patrik Hansson, currently based in the Netherlands, is establishing himself within the field of 19th-century performance practice, bringing a fresh historically informed approach to the romantic symphonic repertoire. He also has a keen interest in contemporary performance and has premiered several contemporary works, including most recently the chamber orchestra version of Martijn Padding’s <i>Unequal Parts</i> with pianist Rutger Jansen as soloist. <br><br>
                        Currently, Andreas is assisting Karel Deseure and the Residentie Orkest (The Hague Philharmonic) in a collaboration with the Dutch National Opera Academy (DNOA) of a fully staged production of <i>Die Fledermaus</i>, premiering in July 2021. He is simultaneously finishing up his master studies at the Dutch National Master of Orchestral Conducting (NMO) with professors Jac van Steen, Kenneth Montgomery, and Ed Spanjaard. Through the program he is enjoying assistantships and masterclasses with major orchestras of the Netherlands and abroad, including the BBC Wales Symphony Orchestra, the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, the North Netherlands Symphony Orchestra, the Dutch National Ballet Orchestra, and many more. <br><br>
                        Although he is yet to finish his master degree, Andreas has considerable professional experience, having conducted concerts with a range of professional orchestras. 2018 saw him conducting concerts with the Lithuanian National Symphony Orchestra, Arctic Philharmonic, Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, and Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra. 2019 brought another project with Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra, as well as concerts with the Nordic Chamber Orchestra and a tour with the Norwegian Army Band. <br><br>
                        Andreas is also active as conductor of the Polar Star Prize Symphony Orchestra, consisting of Sweden’s top young talents, which each year collaborates with the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra in Side-by-Side performances. In 2020 they performed, amongst other works, Stravinsky’s <i>Le Sacre du Printemps</i> together to great acclaim, and the orchestra has ambitious plans for the future. In addition to his conducting activities, Andreas enjoys both ensemble coaching and teaching conducting, which he does regularly at the Swedish National Centre for Musical Talents. <br><br>
                        Before moving to the Netherlands, Andreas completed his Bachelor in conducting at the Norwegian Academy of Music for professors Ole Kristian Ruud and Sigmund Thorp. During his time in Norway, he also won the prestige-filled Opptakt, Norway’s top initiative for young conductors, through which he worked with most major orchestras of the country, including Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Trondheim Symphony Orchestra, Stavanger Symphony Orchestra, and Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra.
                        Furthermore, Andreas has participated in a large range of masterclasses for such esteemed teachers as Neeme and Paavo Järvi, Vasily Petrenko, Martyn Brabbins, Johannes Schlaefli, Nicolás Pasquet, Christian Ehwald, and Mark Stringer.
